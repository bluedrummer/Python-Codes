#Hello thank you for using my program
#By Bluedrummer or https://github.com/bluedrummer?tab=repositories at github.
#This works with Python3.
#What does this propgram do?: This program converts any decimal digit to roman numerals just give it a decimal number.
#WARNING!: Numbers with decimal points will not work.
#Thank you for using.

# NOTES:
# I = 1
# V = 5
# X = 10
# L = 50
# C = 100
# D = 500
# M = 1000
# Addition rule: The same digits next to each other are added
# For example: XXX = 30, XII = 12
#
# Repitition rule: No more than 3 identical digits may follow each other.
#
# Substraction rule: If a smaller number symbol appears infront of a larger one,
# the corresponding value is substracted.
# For example: IV = 4
# The following rules apply to substraction:
# 1. I precedes only V and X
# 2. X precedes only L and C
# 3. C precedes only D and M
#
# Examples:
# 1666 = MDCLXVI
# 2019 = MMXIX
# 2018 = MMXVIII
# 961 = CMLXI
